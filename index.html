        <p>
          I like to be flashy, but minimalism is important to me. This type of
          design is popular among photographers, artists, and fashion labels. The
          stark, unassuming nature of the design provides a blank canvas upon
          which content becomes the absolute focus.

      <div class="about-skeu about-this-design-section">
        <p>
          Remember me? Skeuomorphic design dominated the late 2000's - early
          2010's. Skeuomorphic is a funny word which essentially means design which
          attempts to mimic the physical world. Skeuomorphic design is dominated by
          gratuitous use of shading and lighting, and in more extreme cases, texture
          and graphics to make a digital product resemble it's physical counterpart. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-flat about-this-design-section">
        <p>
          When designers felt Skeuomorphic design was becoming too overbearing,
          there was a large shift in the design world towards stripping out excess
          shading, lighting, and other affordances associated with the previous
          trend. This left us with "Flat" design. To me, flat design means focusing
          on creating clean and usable interfaces without using visual flair as a
          crutch.

          This is everything you should never do. Poor hierarchy, misuse of
          typefaces, dark UI patterns, no consideration for mobile devices,
          obnoxious color pairings, awful contrast,
          distracting elements. Please don't make me do this stuff.

        <p>
          Liberal use of primary colors, larger type, and colored, illustrative,
          iconography are a few of the things that make this design feel whimsical or
          even a bit childish.

      <div class="about-sleek about-this-design-section">
        <p>
          I hesitate to use primarily dark color schemes, due to research
          confirming that black-on-white text is easier to read. However, black is a
          powerful tool. A darker website can evoke feelings of sleek, modern
          exclusivity and mystery. Sometimes I will use a dark scheme when creating a
          site meant to be a counterpart to an already existing property. I also
          think a darker UI is a better fit when working on websites that deal
          primarily with video/other media. This mimics our expectation that
          video/other media appears on a black background, as it does on our TV sets.

          Serif typefaces are seldom used in web design, and for good reason.
          Sans-serif fonts are friendlier and have been proven to be easier to read
          on screens, especially at small sizes. However, when attempting to target
          certain markets or create a sense of luxury, a design using serifs can
          give the impression of a high-end restaurant menu. Furthermore, liberal
          white space, thin strokes, and reserved use of pastel shades give this
          design a feminine energy.

      <div class="about-swiss about-this-design-section">
        <p>
          Swiss design (aka International Typographic Style) is a classic style
          which began to emerge in the 1920's, and is still influencing designers to
          this day. In Swiss design, typography is king. Common hallmarks of Swiss
          design include large, geometric typefaces (most ubiquitously Helvetica),
          rigid alignment to a multi-column grid, and carefully-placed flush-left
          text. Color is used liberally, but usually no more than one color is used
          in a piece.

          Metro isn't the official word, but I've worked extensively inside of the
          Microsoft brand over the last few years and have a good understanding of
          the principles that drive visual style at Microsoft. Large, clean
          typography, bold color fields across a wide palette, and full-bleed imagery
          are a few of the patterns seen in use on current Microsoft web properties.

            I'm a designer who writes code. Sometimes I can be a developer with
            an eye for design, but I consider myself a designer who uses code as
            a primary medium. In creating interfaces this way, I can cut out the
            process of creating any kind of non-browser based mockup, iterate
            incredibly fast on live code, and then serve as a liaison between
            design &amp; development camps as features are being implemented.

        h2.about-header About Me
        
        .about-section-content
          p If you are in the business of creating websites, you want someone
            | on your team who is good with CSS. I'm incredible at writing CSS,
            | and I've spent a lot of time refining a toolchain that allows me to
            | write and iterate on CSS/HTML very quickly. This means I can
            | produce live, interactive mockups just as easily as a traditional
            | Photoshop designer produces a static PSD. 
            
          p In the past I've worked with companies who have realized this,
            | and turned their design process upside-down, stripping out their
            | static mockup designer, and shipping projects directly to me for
            | design in HTML. From there, I can work closely with purely
            | developer-focused team members all the way to project launch. 
            
          p I'm not suggesting I can replace an entire design team: I also
            | work well as a liaison between design and development camps,
            | translating requests from design-land into clear, actionable
            | instructions for developers, or coming back to designers and other
            | stakeholders to explain why their seemingly simple request might
            | involve more developer time than expected.
            
          p.note * I really identify with the description of a "Frontend Designer"
            | explained in <a href="#">this article</a> by Brad Frost. Check it out. 
            | This isn't a position that exists at most companies today, but times are

      .about-section
        h3.about-header My History
        
        .about-section-content
          p I started out my career as a purely visual designer, working in
            | print. A few aggressive mentors I've had taught me strong
            | fundamentals of typography and layout (including the difference
            | between em and en dashes). But print design wasn't for me, because
            | one day, I fell in love with a language called CSS, and started
            | creating websites. After freelancing for a year or two, I began
            | working at various creative agencies. Every one of them has been
            | very fast paced and deadline-focused. I'm used to switching
            | projects on a weekly or daily basis, meaning the amount of websites
            | I've had a hand in deploying is in the hundreds. This gives me a
            | very wide breadth of experience with many different visual styles. 
            
      .about-section
        h3.about-header My Design Philosophy
        
        .about-section-content
          p I like to teach websites tricks. This site knows a few tricks. I
            | want everything I do to be functional, but beyond that I have a
            | more ethereal goal to pleasantly surprise the user. To make the
            | user stop and think: "Woah, that was a little different." I hate
            | out-of-the-box design and I can spot a $50 Wordpress theme before
            | the page finishes rendering. I strive to try something new for each
            | project, even if the ideas I create never make it live,
            | experimentation is what helps me grow as a designer. I think
            | analytics-based approaches to UX make sense at a large scale, but I
            | also think there are UI patterns waiting to be discovered that
            | don't show up in analytics or "best-practice" articles. I
            | experiment in the hopes to discover and test these patterns.

        .tools
          .tool
            h4 Sass
            p I can't live without Sass. I prefer the indented syntax, but I can live
              | with SCSS when needed. I've written my own Sass framework which includes
              | plenty of helper mixins and functions that make my life easier when it comes
              | to repeating patterns across multiple projects. 
              
          .tool
            h4 Javascript/jQuery
            p I typically use Javascript for controlling layout logic. I have some
              | experience creating custom Javascript libraries, but I find most of my needs
              | as a UI designer are served well by existing JS/jQuery plugins. I don't
              | consider myself a Javascript developer, but I know my way around the
              | language.

              | Once the website is done, I will write some text here about how
              | I used ractive.js to help me make this website. 
              
          .tool
            h4 Terminal
            p I'm not scared of the command line. I use zsh because it has great
              | out-of-the-box autocompletion support. I used to use iTerm 2 but decided most
              | of my needs could be serviced by the humble Terminal.app. 
              
          .tool
            h4 Git
            p I use git for version control (suprise!). Typically I use the CLI as I find
              | that to be the most expressive way of doing things. 
              
          .tool
            h4 Jade
            p I use Jade primarily as a way to save keystrokes when creating a static
              | mockups. I like the clean syntax and ability to easily repeat a block of code
              | with different data for the purposes of mocking up a large list.
              
          .tool
            h4 Gulp
            p I often use gulp as a builder/watcher, primarily to compile Sass, but also
              | to compress images and run other preprocessors like Jade if needed. 
              
          .tool
            h4 Vim
            p I fucking love Vim. Vim lets me move extremely fast, which helps greatly
              | when iterating on a design. I've been using vim for about 5 years now and I
              | don't think I can go back. 
              
          .tool
            h4 Adobe Creative Suite
            p I've been using Adobe products my entire career. These days I can get
              | frustrated when spending too much time in Photoshop away from my beloved
              | code, but I know how to get things done across the suite of Adobe visual
              | design products, and still think they are integral tools to my workflow.
