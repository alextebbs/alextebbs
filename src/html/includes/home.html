        I'm a designer who writes code. Sometimes I can be a developer with
        an eye for design, but I consider myself a designer who uses code as
        a primary medium. In creating interfaces this way, I can cut out the
        process of creating any kind of non-browser based mockup, iterate
        incredibly fast on live code, and then serve as a liaison between
        design &amp; development camps as features are being implemented.

        This website is a fun way to prove my experience working
        across many different visual styles and layouts. Click around and try
        out some of the <a class='trigger-theme-select' href="#">different themes</a>. This website knows some more tricks,
        see what you can find.
