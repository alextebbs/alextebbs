              If you are in the business of creating stuff that runs in a
              browser, you want someone on your team who is good with CSS. I'm
              great with CSS, and I've focused on refining a toolchain
              that allows me to iterate on my designs very quickly. This means I
              produce live, interactive mockups in less time than a traditional
              Photoshop designer produces a static PSD.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm not suggesting I can replace an entire design team: I also work
              well as a liaison between design and development camps, translating
              requests from design-land into actionable instructions for
              developers, or interfacing with other stakeholders to explain what
              implications their request has for the development team.

            <p>
              I used to work in print, where I was lucky to have a few aggressive
              mentors teach me strong fundamentals of typography and layout. One
              day I started writing CSS, decided Creative Suite was for the
              birds, and never looked back. Since then, most of my experience has
              been working in very fast-paced and deadline-focused creative
              agencies. I'm used to switching projects on a weekly or daily
              basis, meaning the amount of websites I've had a hand in deploying
              is in the hundreds. This gives me a very wide breadth of experience
              with many different visual styles.

            <p>
              I like to teach websites tricks. This site knows a few tricks. I
              hate out-of-the-box design and blindly following trends. If I had
              it my way, I would focus more on delighting the user, rather than
              converting them. I strive to try something new for each project,
              even if the ideas I create never make it live, experimentation is
              what helps me grow as a designer. An analytics-based approach to UX
              makes sense at a large scale, but there are UI patterns waiting to
              be discovered that don't show up in analytics or "best-practice"
              articles. I experiment in hope of discovering and testing these
              patterns.

          -->

          A code-focused approach to UI design requires a different set of tools
          than is usually advertised. I consider the following set of simple
          text-based tools to be more versatile and efficient than any GUI
          design platform existing today.

              <h4>Sass</h4>
              <p>
                I can't live without Sass. I prefer the indented syntax, but I can
                live with SCSS when needed. I've written my own <a
                href="http://github.com/alextebbs/16x24">Sass framework</a> which
                includes plenty of helper mixins and functions that make my life
                easier when it comes to repeating patterns across multiple projects.

              <h4>Javascript</h4>
              <p>
                I typically use Javascript for controlling layout logic. I have some
                experience creating custom Javascript libraries, but I find most of my needs
                as a UI designer are well served by existing JS/jQuery plugins. I don't
                consider myself a Javascript developer, but I know my way around the
                language.

                write some text here about how I used ractive.js to help me make
                this website.

                I <span class='censor'>fucking</span> love Vim. Vim lets me go
                fast. I've been using Vim for about 6 years now and I don't think I
                can look back.

              <p>
                I'm not scared of the command line. I use zsh because it has great
                out-of-the-box autocompletion support. I used to use iTerm 2 but decided most
                of my needs could be serviced by the humble Terminal.app.

                I use git for version control (suprise!). Typically I use the CLI as I find
                that to be the most expressive way of doing things.

                I use Jade primarily as a way to save keystrokes when building out
                the initial HTML structure of a mockup. I like the clean syntax and
                ability to easily repeat a block of code with different data for
                the purposes of mocking up a large list.

                to compress images and run other preprocessors like Jade if needed.

                I've been using Adobe products my entire career. These days I can get
                frustrated when spending too much time in Photoshop away from my
                code, but I know how to get things done across the suite of Adobe visual
                design products, and still think they are integral tools to my workflow.
