        <p>
          If you are in the business of creating websites, you want someone
          on your team who is good with CSS. I'm incredible at writing CSS,
          and I've spent a lot of time refining a toolchain that allows me to
          write and iterate on CSS/HTML very quickly. This means I can
          produce live, interactive mockups just as easily as a traditional
          Photoshop designer produces a static PSD.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past I've worked with companies who have realized this,
          and turned their design process upside-down, stripping out their
          static mockup designer, and shipping projects directly to me for
          design in HTML. From there, I can work closely with purely
          developer-focused team members all the way to project launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not suggesting I can replace an entire design team: I also
          work well as a liaison between design and development camps,
          translating requests from design-land into clear, actionable
          instructions for developers, or coming back to designers and other
          stakeholders to explain why their seemingly simple request might
          involve more developer time than expected.

          explained in <a href="#">this article</a> by Brad Frost. Check it out.
          This isn't a position that exists at most companies today, but times are
          changing.

      <h3 class="about-header">My History</h3>
      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>
          I started out my career as a purely visual designer, working in
          print. A few aggressive mentors I've had taught me strong
          fundamentals of typography and layout (including the difference
          between em and en dashes). But print design wasn't for me, because
          one day, I fell in love with a language called CSS, and started
          creating websites. After freelancing for a year or two, I began
          working at various creative agencies. Every one of them has been
          very fast paced and deadline-focused. I'm used to switching
          projects on a weekly or daily basis, meaning the amount of websites
          I've had a hand in deploying is in the hundreds. This gives me a
          very wide breadth of experience with many different visual styles.

      <h3 class="about-header">My Design Philosophy</h3>
      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>
          I like to teach websites tricks. This site knows a few tricks. I
          want everything I do to be functional, but beyond that I have a
          more ethereal goal to pleasantly surprise the user. To make the
          user stop and think: "Woah, that was a little different." I hate
          out-of-the-box design and I can spot a $50 Wordpress theme before
          the page finishes rendering. I strive to try something new for each
          project, even if the ideas I create never make it live,
          experimentation is what helps me grow as a designer. I think
          analytics-based approaches to UX make sense at a large scale, but I
          also think there are UI patterns waiting to be discovered that
          don't show up in analytics or "best-practice" articles. I
          experiment in the hopes to discover and test these patterns.

      <h3 class="about-header">My Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the basics (Yes I know HTML and CSS), here are some specific
        libraries and tools I use to get shit done.
      </p>
      <div class="tools">
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Sass</h4>
          <p>
            I can't live without Sass. I prefer the indented syntax, but I can live
            with SCSS when needed. I've written my own Sass framework which includes
            plenty of helper mixins and functions that make my life easier when it comes
            to repeating patterns across multiple projects.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Javascript/jQuery</h4>
          <p>
            I typically use Javascript for controlling layout logic. I have some
            experience creating custom Javascript libraries, but I find most of my needs
            as a UI designer are served well by existing JS/jQuery plugins. I don't
            consider myself a Javascript developer, but I know my way around the
            language.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Ractive.js</h4>
          <p>
            Lipsum Dolor sit amet. I dont know Ractive but i want to use it to make this website.
            Once the website is done, I will write some text here about how
            I used ractive.js to help me make this website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Terminal</h4>
          <p>
            I'm not scared of the command line. I use zsh because it has great
            out-of-the-box autocompletion support. I used to use iTerm 2 but decided most
            of my needs could be serviced by the humble Terminal.app.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Git</h4>
          <p>
            I use git for version control (suprise!). Typically I use the CLI as I find
            that to be the most expressive way of doing things.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Jade</h4>
          <p>
            I use Jade primarily as a way to save keystrokes when creating a static
            mockups. I like the clean syntax and ability to easily repeat a block of code
            with different data for the purposes of mocking up a large list.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Gulp</h4>
          <p>
            I often use gulp as a builder/watcher, primarily to compile Sass, but also
            to compress images and run other preprocessors like Jade if needed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Vim</h4>
          <p>
            I fucking love Vim. Vim lets me move extremely fast, which helps greatly
            when iterating on a design. I've been using vim for about 5 years now and I
            don't think I can go back.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tool">
          <h4>Adobe Creative Suite</h4>
          <p>
            I've been using Adobe products my entire career. These days I can get
            frustrated when spending too much time in Photoshop away from my beloved
            code, but I know how to get things done across the suite of Adobe visual
            design products, and still think they are integral tools to my workflow.
