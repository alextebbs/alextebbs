  <div class="about-minimal about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      I like to be flashy, but minimalism is important to me. This type of
      design is popular among photographers, artists, and fashion labels. The
      stark, unassuming nature of the design provides a blank canvas upon
      which content becomes the absolute focus.

  <div class="about-skeu about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Remember me? Skeuomorphic design dominated the late 2000's - early
      2010's. Skeuomorphic is a funny word which essentially means design which
      attempts to mimic the physical world. Skeuomorphic design is dominated by
      gratuitous use of shading and lighting, and in more extreme cases, texture
      and graphics to make a digital product resemble it's physical counterpart.

  <div class="about-flat about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      When designers felt Skeuomorphic design was becoming too overbearing,
      there was a large shift in the design world towards stripping out excess
      shading, lighting, and other affordances associated with the previous
      trend. This left us with "Flat" design. To me, flat design means focusing
      on creating clean and usable interfaces without using visual flair as a
      crutch.

  <div class="about-bad about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      This is everything you should never do. Poor hierarchy, misuse of
      typefaces, dark UI patterns, no consideration for mobile devices,
      obnoxious color pairings, awful contrast, distracting elements. Please
      don't make me do this stuff.

  <div class="about-whimsical about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Liberal use of primary colors, larger type, and colored, illustrative,
      iconography are a few of the things that make this design feel whimsical or
      even a bit childish. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-sleek about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      I hesitate to use primarily dark color schemes, due to research
      confirming that black-on-white text is easier to read. However, black is a
      powerful tool. A darker website can evoke feelings of sleek, modern
      exclusivity and mystery. Sometimes I will use a dark scheme when creating a
      site meant to be a counterpart to an already existing property. I also
      think a darker UI is a better fit when working on websites that deal
      primarily with video/other media. This mimics our expectation that
      video/other media appears on a black background, as it does on our TV sets.

  <div class="about-elegant about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Serif typefaces are seldom used in web design, and for good reason.
      Sans-serif fonts are friendlier and have been proven to be easier to read
      on screens, especially at small sizes. However, when attempting to target
      certain markets or create a sense of luxury, a design using serifs can
      give the impression of a high-end restaurant menu. Furthermore, liberal
      white space, thin strokes, and reserved use of pastel shades give this
      design a feminine energy.

  <div class="about-swiss about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Swiss design (aka International Typographic Style) is a classic style
      which began to emerge in the 1920's, and is still influencing designers to
      this day. In Swiss design, typography is king. Common hallmarks of Swiss
      design include large, geometric typefaces (most ubiquitously Helvetica),
      rigid alignment to a multi-column grid, and carefully-placed flush-left
      text. Color is used liberally, but usually no more than one color is used
      in a piece.

  <div class="about-brutalist about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Originating from architecture, the term "Brutalism" refers to design
      that is intentionally raw and unpolished. In the context of web design,
      this usually means rejecting commmon user interface patterns in favor of
      presenting a design so aggressive it almost shocks the user into
      sticking around to enjoy the content.

  <div class="about-metro about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Metro isn't the official word, but I've worked extensively inside of the
      Microsoft brand over the last few years and have a good understanding of
      the principles that drive visual style at Microsoft. Large, clean
      typography, bold color fields across a wide palette, and full-bleed imagery
      are a few of the patterns seen in use on current Microsoft web properties.
