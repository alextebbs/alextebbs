      <h4>
        <div class='name'>Extreme Arts & Sciences</div>
        <div class='date'>2014 - 2017</div>
      </h4>
      <p>At Extreme Arts <span class='amp'>&amp;</span> Sciences (EAS), I am
      the primary web designer and resident CSS expert. EAS immediately
      realized the value of bringing someone onto the team who has a deep
      understanding of code-based layout design. EAS is a fast-paced creative
      agency, constantly juggling multiple projects at once, all of them
      with tight deadlines. My approach to user interface design and iterative
      prototyping helps us meet these deadlines and produce solutions
      that our clients always walk away happy from.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Dreamtime is a small creative agency based out of Spokane, Washington. I
      was the primary assistant to the business owner, taking his website design
      mockups and building them out in CSS, as well as designing the mobile and
      tablet versions of the websites. At Dreamtime I learned most of what I now
      know about responsive design as well as an introduction to working with CMS
      systems in the form of ExpressionEngine.</p>

      <p>Signature Genomics is a genetics testing company specializing in
      microarray testing. At Signature I worked across print and interactive
      media. My duties included designing and branding new collateral, as well
      as updating the markup and visual design of Signature Genomicsâ€™ website
      and proprietary web application: Genoglyphix. I began as an intern and
      then was hired onto the team shortly afterwards.</p>
