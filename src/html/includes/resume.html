      <h4>
        <div class='name'>Extreme Arts & Sciences</div>
        <div class='date'>2014 - 2017</div>
      </h4>
      <p>At Extreme Arts & Sciences (EAS), I am the primary interface designer
      and resident CSS expert. As a fast-paced creative agency, EAS immediately
      realized the value of bringing someone onto the team who could rapidly
      produce fully interactive experiences. We constantly juggle multiple
      projects at once, all of them with tight deadlines. My approach to user
      interface design and iterative prototyping helps us meet these deadlines
      & produce solutions that our clients always walk away from happy.</p>

      <h4>
        <div class='name'>DreamTime Studios</div>
        <div class='date'>2012 - 2014</div>
      </h4>
      <p>Dreamtime is a small creative agency based out of Spokane, Washington.
      Iâ€™m very grateful for my time spent here, working as the second employee
      for an experienced developer/designer. At Dreamtime, I gained a
      foundation for what I now know about responsive design and multi-device
      layouts as well as an thorough introduction to working with content
      management systems in the form of ExpressionEngine.</p>

      <h4>
        <div class='name'>Signature Genomics</div>
        <div class='date'>2010 - 2012</div>
      </h4>
      <p>Signature Genomics is a genetics testing company specializing in
      microarray testing. At Signature I had the opportunity to work under an
      experienced print designer, and gained a strong understanding of the
      fundamentals of typography and layout. After proving my experience with
      web technologies through maintaining the main Signature website, I was
      tasked with updates and revisions to our proprietary web-based
      genome-exploration product: Genogyphics. This started my interest into
      the world of web design. I began here as an intern and then was hired
      onto the team shortly afterwards.</p>
