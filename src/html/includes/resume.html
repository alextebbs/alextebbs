      <div class='name'>Extreme Arts & Sciences</div>
      <div class='date'>2013 - 2017</div>
    </h4>
    <p>At Extreme Arts & Sciences (EAS), I am the primary web designer and
    resident CSS expert. EAS immediately realized the value of bringing someone
    onto the team who has a deep understanding of code-based layout design, and
    since then I have been providing value ever since. The enviroment in the
    office is insanely fast paced (even chaotic at times), and our
    deadlines are always incredibly tight. I find my approach to user interface
    design helps me meet these tight deadlines and produce solutions that our
    clients always walk away happy from.</p>

      <div class='name'>DreamTime Studios</div>
      <div class='date'>2013 - 2017</div>
    </h4>
    <p>Dreamtime is a small creative agency based out of Spokane, Washington. I
    was the primary assistant to the business owner, taking his website design
    mockups and building them out in CSS, as well as designing the mobile and
    tablet versions of the websites. At Dreamtime I learned most of what I now
    know about responsive design as well as an introduction to working with CMS
    systems in the form of ExpressionEngine.</p>

    <h4>
      <div class='name'>Signature Genomics</div>
      <div class='date'>2011 - 2013</div>
    </h4>
    <p>I began my career as a print designer working for a genetics company in
    Spokane, Washington. I worked under a mentor laying out print documents and
    brochures for physicians to present to potential patients. It was here that
    I learned the value of detail and rigourous attention to typography.</p>
