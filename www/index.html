  <div class="about-minimal about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      I like to be flashy, but minimalism is important to me. This type of
      design is popular among photographers, artists, and fashion labels. The
      stark, unassuming nature of the design provides a blank canvas upon
      which content becomes the absolute focus. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-skeu about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Remember me? Skeuomorphic design dominated the late 2000's - early
      2010's. Skeuomorphic is a funny word which essentially means design which
      attempts to mimic the physical world. Skeuomorphic design is dominated by
      gratuitous use of shading and lighting, and in more extreme cases, texture
      and graphics to make a digital product resemble it's physical counterpart. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-flat about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      When designers felt Skeuomorphic design was becoming too overbearing,
      there was a large shift in the design world towards stripping out excess
      shading, lighting, and other affordances associated with the previous
      trend. This left us with "Flat" design. To me, flat design means focusing
      on creating clean and usable interfaces without using visual flair as a
      crutch. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-bad about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      This is everything you should never do. Poor hierarchy, misuse of
      typefaces, dark UI patterns, no consideration for mobile devices,
      obnoxious color pairings, awful contrast, distracting elements. Please
      don't make me do this stuff.

  <div class="about-whimsical about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Liberal use of primary colors, larger type, and colored, illustrative,
      iconography are a few of the things that make this design feel whimsical or
      even a bit childish. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-sleek about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      I hesitate to use primarily dark color schemes, due to research
      confirming that black-on-white text is easier to read. However, black is a
      powerful tool. A darker website can evoke feelings of sleek, modern
      exclusivity and mystery. Sometimes I will use a dark scheme when creating a
      site meant to be a counterpart to an already existing property. I also
      think a darker UI is a better fit when working on websites that deal
      primarily with video/other media. This mimics our expectation that
      video/other media appears on a black background, as it does on our TV sets. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-elegant about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Serif typefaces are seldom used in web design, and for good reason.
      Sans-serif fonts are friendlier and have been proven to be easier to read
      on screens, especially at small sizes. However, when attempting to target
      certain markets or create a sense of luxury, a design using serifs can
      give the impression of a high-end restaurant menu. Furthermore, liberal
      white space, thin strokes, and reserved use of pastel shades give this
      design a feminine energy.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-swiss about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Swiss design (aka International Typographic Style) is a classic style
      which began to emerge in the 1920's, and is still influencing designers to
      this day. In Swiss design, typography is king. Common hallmarks of Swiss
      design include large, geometric typefaces (most ubiquitously Helvetica),
      rigid alignment to a multi-column grid, and carefully-placed flush-left
      text. Color is used liberally, but usually no more than one color is used
      in a piece. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-brutalist about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Originating from architecture, the term "Brutalism" refers to design
      that is intentionally raw and unpolished. In the context of web design,
      this usually means rejecting commmon user interface patterns in favor of
      presenting a design so aggressive it almost shocks the user into
      sticking around to enjoy the content.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="about-metro about-this-design-section">
    <p>
      Metro isn't the official word, but I've worked extensively inside of the
      Microsoft brand over the last few years and have a good understanding of
      the principles that drive visual style at Microsoft. Large, clean
      typography, bold color fields across a wide palette, and full-bleed imagery
      are a few of the patterns seen in use on current Microsoft web properties.

            I'm a designer who uses code as my primary medium. In creating
            interfaces this way, I cut out the process of creating non-browser

            bridge between design <span class='amp'>&amp;</span> development
            camps throughout the entire development cycle.

              If you are in the business of creating stuff that runs in a
              browser, you want someone on your team who is good with CSS. I'm
              great with CSS, and I've focused on refining a toolchain
              that allows me to iterate on my designs very quickly. This means I
              produce live, interactive mockups in less time than a traditional
              Photoshop designer produces a static PSD.

              I also work well as a liaison between designers <span

              design-land into actionable instructions for developers, or

              their request has for the development team.

              mentors teach me strong fundamentals of typography
              <span class='amp'>&amp;</span> layout. One day I started writing
              CSS, decided Creative Suite was for chumps, and never looked
              back. Since then, most of my experience has been working in very
              fast-paced and deadline-focused creative agencies. I'm used to
              switching projects on a weekly or daily basis, meaning the amount
              of websites I've had a hand in deploying is in the hundreds. This
              gives me a very wide breadth of experience with many different

              I like to teach websites tricks. This site knows a few tricks. I
              hate out-of-the-box design and blindly following trends. If I had
              it my way, I would focus more on delighting the user, rather than
              converting them. I strive to try something new for each project,
              even if the ideas I create never make it live, experimentation is
              what helps me grow as a designer. An analytics-based approach to UX
              makes sense at a large scale, but there are UI patterns waiting to
              be discovered that don't show up in analytics or "best-practice"
              articles. I experiment in hope of discovering and testing these
              patterns.

      <h3>Experience</h3>

      <h4>
        <div class='name'>Extreme Arts &amp; Sciences</div>
        <div class='date'>2014 - 2018</div>
      </h4>
      <p>At Extreme Arts &amp; Sciences (EAS), I am the primary interface designer
      and resident CSS expert. As a fast-paced creative agency, EAS immediately
      realized the value of bringing someone onto the team who could rapidly
      produce fully interactive experiences. We constantly juggle multiple
      projects at once, all of them with tight deadlines. My approach to user
      interface design and iterative prototyping helps us meet these deadlines
      &amp; produce solutions that our clients always walk away from happy.</p>

      <h4>
        <div class='name'>DreamTime Studios</div>
        <div class='date'>2012 - 2014</div>
      </h4>
      <p>Dreamtime is a small creative agency based out of Spokane, Washington.
      I’m very grateful for my time spent here, working as the second employee
      for an experienced developer/designer. At Dreamtime, I gained a
      foundation for what I now know about responsive design and multi-device
      layouts as well as an thorough introduction to working with content
      management systems in the form of ExpressionEngine.</p>

      <h4>
        <div class='name'>Signature Genomics</div>
        <div class='date'>2010 - 2012</div>
      </h4>
      <p>Signature Genomics is a genetics testing company specializing in
      microarray testing. At Signature I had the opportunity to work under an
      experienced print designer, and gained a strong understanding of the
      fundamentals of typography and layout. After proving my experience with
      web technologies through maintaining the main Signature website, I was
      tasked with updates and revisions to our proprietary web-based
      genome-exploration product: Genogyphics. This started my interest into
      the world of web design. I began here as an intern and then was hired
      onto the team shortly afterwards.</p>
